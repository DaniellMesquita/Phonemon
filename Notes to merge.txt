- Tamigucho Chimp & Bono (Afrah)
- Tamigucho A & B (Munnah)
- Tamigucho Mercury & ? (Valorium)
- Tamigucho Bow & Arrow (Brava)
- Tamigucho Carbon & Oxygen

- first post of tamigucho inst (Petalrock official design and descriptions)

Tamigucho Pink & Blue comes first.
Santapolos: get a BrasPass and make a street store; Pq Vllbs gray
-
The first generation could come in two parts with two versions each.
Brava should divide in half.
In the first year, Bow & Arrow (& Afrah's version). In the next, Pink & Blue (& Purple/Violet).
Tamigucho Purple/Violet will contain both parts of Brava and an new plot.
Tamigucho ? beyond containing the full Brava will also introduce the Afrah region)
All of these 4 adventure sets will fulfill the first generation which will be based in two regions.
Tamigucho ? probably will be launched 3 years after Bow & Arrow, the same year the launch of Tamigucho A & B.
-
Tamigucho Bow & Arrow will be limited in comparison to Tamigucho Purple/Violet which will complete it.
Tamigucho ? will support AC dualscreen
-
Femantis/Femee, from Hipsterville
Machape/Maletta, from Kuritribe
Transect is from the Amaze forest
Tamigucho Bow & Arrow legendaries are Plant/Dragon and Fire/Steel (their top legendary is at Afrah region)
Tamigucho Pink & Blue will contain all regions from South and also Santapolos/Rioja/Bravilia, and 6 Degrees (while Bow & Arrow will also introduce 6 Degrees)
Kuritribe's Degree host will like to hop in walls; Hipterville or Balnesea's Degree host will like to sleep on trees and swing/jump between them; Both bluewhite.
Rename Kuritribe
Rioja Degree host will be a brwn wmn

Tamigucho games' timelines and mons' generations are very confusing.
I have to do something that make sense.
Tamigucho
- anti-cheat server
- COPA-compliant
- ptl drawing with parts and animations
- rub your mons (they react depending on the part)
- Tamigucho statuses: Happiness, Feed, Fear, HP, PP, Morale?, Histamin?
- ptl is rare to get algaes (unless it gets enough garden time every sunny day), but implement the function to register it before implementing the algaes
- colors of Petalrock: 50% white with possible algaes; others are gray (20% - have 50% less algaes), brown (20% - 75% less algaes), pink (5% - 50% if player is girl), blue (5% - 50% if player is boy) (pink and blue Petalrock are Brava region exclusives)
- cozy
- bedroom
- shop
- playroom
- garden
- plantable berries and other vegetables
- Cozy time
- battles (Probability of same-time attacks, combinations)
-
Tamigucho Fire üî• (Syamagma, Bulbomb, Firember), Water üíß(Waterabbit, Waterain, Dewhale), Leaf üçÉ (Bulball)
Can choose only one mon per game, and NFT'ing them will depend on KYC
- Adventure mode (can be choosen in only one game per account)
(plot: the bond between humans and mons; Region: Hizashi)
- All of the 2010-2013 mons
-
Tamigucho Pink & Blue (plot: gender differences+difficulties, gray morality, love vs. doing what is seen as need with ends worthing means, trust, lack of pragmatism but lack of altruism; Region: Parano; Starter mons: require Tamigucho (normal), Fire, Water or Leaf)
- All of the 2010-2015 mons
- Co-op mode
Tamigucho Mercury & Ethanol (plot: the value of everyone including those who look "valueless"; Region: Valorium)
- All of the 2010-2017 mons

- All of the 2010-2022 mons
Tamigucho Cyan & Magenta (3D remakes of Pink & Blue)
The next games will require game engine to migrate to React Native (Unreal). Then, they'll work on phones but'll only show their true power on PCs/PS/XB. They'll have photorealistic graphics and VR

- TamiStorage: Stickerffects

I feel me ashamed for what I believe; for what I'm doing.
I don't want to use y'all; not fame, nor money.
My wish, from my whole heart and the deep of my soul, is to cross barriers and frontiers that separates us.
I want to give'em our tech, and explain things about them

Accessories GBA will need for Tamigucho:
- GBA Plus (a case with secondary screen?, cam, microphone, wifi, BLE, NFC, etc)
Secondary screen and other real-time devices may need a cartridge adapter so the game can exchange data directly with the GBA Plus without passing to the GBA first
GBA Plus will have the ability to download software updates for the cartridge!
Instead of GBA Plus, the cartridge could be modified to work like so
This may spark the launch of the New GBA
Port to SNES?

- re-draw Qrosstum
- re-draw legendary mons of 2010

First game is based on real brazilian locations, with Team Petami?
Team Petami uses the eco concerns as weapon to eliminate humans (while doing so to the Tamiguchos, instead - until it is told humans are the true victims in the Tamigucho world). Qrosstum will tell about the human/animals universe where an equivalent of Team Petami wants creatures using humans to battle and hurting them as revenge while the team itself is decimating animals

phrases by NPCs:
- Technology got so advanced, that you can store Tamiguchos in a flat card rather than these big blocks. In this state, they minimize by a lot!
- TamiCards are the tiniest computers, inspired by nanotech. These tiny computers have a processing unit in the main board, a storage unit similar to a RAM memory where tamiguchos are stored as energy, and a battery that is constantly getting energy from the environment in order to charge. Not enough, the surface of TamiCards are e-ink always-on screens!! Welcome to the future!
- People do still use TamiBlocks nowaday. Why? Because it's cool!
- I love TamiCards but I think TamiBlocks will never turn old. My sense does also tells me that Tamiguchos feel more comfortable at TamiBlocks!
- When a single Algalone defeats 9 Algalones in a streak, they merge and morph into Algalthea!
- Listening to the sounds of Birdumonts flying, I feel me so calm!
- Humans have too much words for Tamigucho's minds. They appear to be understanding our words but that's more profound than we thought: they are reading our feelings
- Tamiguchos don't go with words, but feelings. Even when they appear to be talking, all they are doing is, expressing their feelings. This means Tamiguchos from very distinct species are able to talk to one another by just understading feelings!
- When a Tamigucho is running away, even if you throw a beam to call'em back, the TamiStorages won't work. TamiCards, TamiBlocks were made to respect the freedom of the creatures.
- If a creature is running away from their tamer, they may have a reason for this. If the tamer forces, their TamiStorage may even get deactivated, and the Tamigucho will be de-marked and return to its status of wild, free to join another tamer... ...or not
- Weakening a Tamigucho to catch it is moraly biased. They should join you by their free will. TamiStorages were updated to be more comfortable and better display the aura of a tamer so the to-be-caught creature can know and trust before even knowing! So, the catch rate has been generously increased in recent updates, while still being moral.
- You can minimize some TamiStorage so it costs less physical space when you're carrying. You can't do that to TamiCards, but you can with TamiBlocks! But, who would need to minify TamiCards? They're already too light!
- My favorite TamiStorage are TamiBlocks! For Taminecraft players, blocks are everything! I can stack a pile and piles of TamiBlocks and they'll look like edifices!
- TamiCards, TamiBlocks... ...what are the standard TamiStorage? No one know, and that's the nice thing about it! The default TamiStorage depends on opinion and personal choice! Variety of options!
- Team Petami want Tamiguchos to capture humans and use us in battles. But I do ask myself: would Team Petami also desire to be captured and used in battles?
- A very powerful Tamigucho from the mugenkizuna region, told me humans are weak, live shortly and are used to combat one another, so one day the world will be inhabited by Tamigucho-like humans and Tamiguchos only
- mugenkizuna region? I've heard humans and animals once lived together peacefully, until some humans started to use chickens and fishes to battle. In that time, Team Petami was called Team Ecofas. Team Bluehead's plan was working and saving these animals from pain, but Team Ecofas wanted more, and beat-up Team Bluehead. Team Ecofas used spatial powers to turn all the animals into Tamiguchos, and used them to hurt humans, even the innocent ones... ...except themselves, so Team Ecofas were safe dominating Tamiguchos to dominate humans. While Team Bluehead wanted both animals and humans safe, Team Ecofas put them both in pain while babbling this as "justice" for the animals. But cross-universe appeared, won agains't Team Ecofas and rebuilt the world. Nowadays, humans are still weaker than Tamiguchos while Tamiguchos' work is to get stronger.
- I would call the Brava region as the side B. There's a region which is side A, the first side. A region which is the origin of the Tamigucho universe. Are you leaving side A to enter side B? Oh, are Brava the side A? Whatever! Just jump and go on, to the next!
- I'm also from the mugenkizuna region. I've heard cross-universe was captured two times. The first time, it was captured by a good person, and decided to partner it in a journey, until this person agreed with cross-universe to release it. The second time? An evil person did so, but here's the twist: cross-universe exited its TamiBlock, broke it and never more we heard of a capture. It happened several times with other Tamiguchos, too. We can't even try to re-capture if that happens.
- "Please define "evil""?
- Anything that seeks for the death of the things is evil. Living is good. Simply existing is good.
- When a strong bond between a Tamigucho and its tamer is formed, they can liberate power of all types. This includes transforming and, morphing, too.
- When two tamers and a Tamigucho loves one another, these tamers can share this Tamigucho by using a cross-tamer TamiStorage!
- So, do you know how a cross-tamer TamiCard work? If a Tamigucho shows affection for both you and your friend, you two will put a cross-tamer cover on a TamiCard, sync it with a second cover and launch it. For TamiBlocks? You put a cross-trainer capsule instead of a cover!
- When two people have the same Tamigucho, both will have a cross-tamer cover or capsule. They can't carry the same Tamigucho at the same time, but they can pass to one another according to needs. When calling a cross-tamer Tamigucho from the other tamer, its TamiStorage is teleported to your cover or capsule!
- Are you going to Carnival Contests? People call'em Carnivests.
- Thankfully the Tamigucho universe isn't about battles. Isn't about a single thing exclusively. You can choose any way.
- In Carnival Contests, your Tamiguchos and yourself, your hearts, are warmed and synced to display the fullest of your artistic talent! ‚ù£Ô∏è
- Carnivests are hosted in most cities, but the best and most competitive happens in the Rioja city only! ??
- You can buy clothes for yourself and your Tamiguchos! Although, biped Tamiguchos using clothes is a bit disturbing.
- If you put Stickerffects on your TamiStorage, diverse effects can appear when you launch a Tamigucho. These are more than useful in Carnival Contests! These are beautifly!
- Yes, he've nicknamed our Borboll as "Beautifly". I love how people can be soooo creative! BTW, if you love your Tamiguchos, you should have lovely and special names for them! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
- I come from a very cold place of the mugenkizuna region. I traveled to Brava just for the Carnival! Me and my Butterfreeze are in sync with cold nerves but warm hearts! Ah yes, my Butterfreeze is a Borboll, too!
- We are all close together here because we share the same love for Borbolls! Mine I call Bravuleta, because we love the Brava region!
- Fuse the Butterfreeze and Beautifly names? You'll have the original name: Butterfly!
- Fusing? What about Beautifreez?!
- [Borboll's phrase] {nickname}: booooor!
- I think there are about 100 Tamiguchos, no?
- There are 150 Tamiguchos! Too much!
- No, there are 950 or 1000 Tamiguchos if you counter other regions
- Counting regions? Then there are 5000 for sure.
- Y'all are playing too low
-
Second game is based in a space/time distortion region, with Team Quantic and Qrosstum as legendary
TamiStorages' Stickerffects
Games: Tamigucho A & B (+Z)
Region: mugenkizuna ÁÑ°ÈôêÁµÜ Infinite bond (Mugezuna? Mugezuh? Mukizun? I can't see a western version for this)
Locations:
- New Palleaf
- Vererna Forest (Gruboll, Boboll)
- Mt. Coronoon (Funry)
phrases by NPCs:
- Technology got so advanced, that a machine to read not only emotions and dreams, but also fully translate what a Tamigucho is meaning, is already available!
- A region that had a war? We call it Warto. The new champion was son of that team's leader. These are some of the data we found in the Temporary city
- mugenkizuna was the first region of the Tamigucho universe, fruit of a space/time distortion. Its origin? Some say it is Mt. Coronoon
- Qrosstum is the only creature known to travel through the multiverse, being cross-universe.
- Qrosstum have a special love for the Tamigucho universe; may it be the cause of space/time distortions and our origin? Some say Qrosstum regularly visits or even lives in Mt. Coronoon, but no expedition ever was able to confirm it
- Qrosstum have so many universes to visit in the infinite multiverse, that I doubt it only have a preferred one
- Team Quantic affirm Qrosstum exist, and some say to have seen it; but no video footage available so... ...legends are just legends.
- Until someone proves it exist, nobody can affirm it don't exist!
- Mt. Coronoon reaches all of the 4 edges of the region. Paradoxically, it is the most accessible and most inaccessible place at the same time.
- You can enter Mt. Coronoon from any place, easily; but on the other hand, advancing on it is hard
- Qrosstum is the most powerful Tamigucho...  ...except that, there's only one creature that can beat Qrosstum, and it isn't here in the Tamigucho universe
- The creature that made Qrosstum? Its name is a mix between Archaic, hmmmm, Ark, and Zeus, according to the fragmented data we got from the Temporary city
- In other universes, probably Tamiguchos aren't known as Tamiguchos. As we seek to explore planets, the next frontier is exploring universes and the time
- Based in data from the Temporary City, in pre-ancient times humans and other creatures were one. If these creatures can be called Tamiguchos, then... ...are humans some sort of Tamiguchos?
- Any TamiStorage, such as TamiCards and TamiBlocks, are charged everyday, everyhour nonstopping! Both by darkness and light, be it natural or artificial, there's no condition preventing the containing tamiguchos from receiving life/energy!
- When you store a Tamigucho inside a card or block, they are converted from matter to energy. TamiBlocks is a primitive storage but still used nowadays that we have tinner, flat cards!
- What happens inside TamiStorages such as TamiCards or TamiBlocks? You wonder; everybody wonders! When Tamiguchos are converted into energy, an environment made of energy is also artificially created, stored in the RAM. It can be a garden, a lake, a forest, a jungle, a sea! If you ask you are right: Tamiguchos are consciously awake inside TamiStorages, so they need a nice environment they love to live in! They don't need to eat as energy, but probably they'll always want to play and rest!
- Tamiguchos can enter or leave TamiStorages at their own pace and will, as they are conscientious inside it, just as they were when inside an egg.
- He's right! Ah, yes, just as they were in the egg: they are aware of everything happening outside, and can even feel the energy and heat of their tamer and colleagues of neighbor TamiStorages!
- Most of the data collected in the Temporary city are in the hands of Team Quantic. Probably they were aware a space/time distortion could make a place or a whole city and eagerly expecting for it. I'm sure they have maps and data of many universes
- A villainous team of the hypothetical Warto region... ...Team Red? wanted to conquer the world. A villainous team of the hypothetical region of... ...Sinnabar? They wanted to conquer the universe. But Team Quantic? They are insane! They want to catch the hypothetical Qrosstum to travel and conquer many hypothetical universes...
- Did I just heard about the Warto and that Cinnamon, err, Sinnabar region? The scientists who studied in the Temporary city, said parts of these regions were merged and became part of our region! Data also pointed that the Tamigucho universe is made of, well, contains parts of a lot of different universes. This may explain why Qrosstum is said to have a so special affection for this region... ...I mean, if it ever existed, in the first place!
- If all of that news are just legends... ...why that Temporary city suddenly appeared next to Mt. Coronoon's Quantum Temple? This was even filmed and covered extensively. But, unfortunately, no one ever was able to record Qrosstum... ...yet!
- Who was able to see the Temporary city? Everyone! But who was able to enter it? Scientists and officers, before they were forcibly removed by Team Quantic.
- Scientists who visited the Temporary city were robbed and had to leave. But they bought their memory with them and we were able to know some things that Team Quantic knows better than us. But we aren't ignorant at all!
- My favorite leaked data about the Temporary city? Is about the Wormorph's relatives in other universes. There are a slimmy thing that is result of an unsuccessful clone, but despite failed both this slime and Wormorph had a library-like DNA preserved. I don't see them as a failure. Some great discoveries were made off failures!
- Both male and female Funry are fungus... ...and fairies, and from the same species. But why are them so different?
- Scientists don't lose their attention when the topic is about other scientists. They heard and told us about a weird scientist from an other universe. Jimmy, was once part of a criminal group but debanded and turned into a great scientist. Despite being part of a villainous team, they never were truly evil. We look forward to hear more but data is so fragmented and mixed with rumors, that we got ourselves lost on them. Probably Team Quantic knows what is sound and what is noise!
- I don't appreciate incomplete information. That scientist? One of his experiments was teaching creatures to talk! They were also teaching slimmy creatures to be more confident, social and improve their mimicking.
- In our region, even the non-scientists loves to talk about quantum things! Its in our DNA! The dead cat is alive ahoooo!
- That scientist Jimmy? He found back his... ...Firember? His loyal friend returned and they never more separated. His friend from the former villainous team was also officially captured by him. He merged all his friends from past and present!
- I don't know a thing about that scientist. The information we got at Temporary city is very scarse.
- Traveling through universes, and traveling in time are the same thing! We heard of a creature called "Celebrant of Times" who was able to timetravel, but never heard of traveling through universes. Probably this creature was able to travel through a single track, in this case a single timeline! But every quantum second that passes, we and our actions are creating new universes that we simply call "time passing". Creating universes is easy, but undoing actions or traveling through them? I've heard only Qrosstum is able to.
- A folkloric, legendary, mythical Tamigucho: they may appear unique but there may be more than one individuals from the same specie. Can they reproduce? They are genderless and most say they and can't. But yes, they can and they do. But not in captivity. Their reproduction is rare even in their native environment.
- If NestHouses, daycares were able to reproduce mythical Tamiguchos, that would pose a risk to the very species and, to all other including humans
- Past, future and present may be mixed in a space/time distortion. At the Temporary city, we got confusing facts about the same stuff but in different timelines.
- Why people are surprised with that Temporary city? Space/time distortions are common in our region, even the multiversal ones!
- There are no "default" and "alternative" universes. Earth isn't the only planet nor the center of our universe. Same about universes: our universe is also "alternative" to other universes, so there's no default. That's relative.
- People say "alternative universes" as if our universe were normal and all others weird. We shall drop that multiversal phobias, bias. Out of our comfort zone, we should accept the fact that our very universe is also weird to the others!
- Probably other universes don't know about the Tamigucho universe. But we are somewhat aware about theirs! That's a nice privilege Qrosstum gave us.
- I was once able to talk Qrosstum! I asked for a multiversal travel but she said only special people can travel with. Qrosstum also said other things, but asked me to be confident so I'll respect.
- I was with him in this day when we met her. She's soooo sweet! We became friends! She transformed into human and we used to walk together! But now she's busy ü§ï
- This is the Qrosstum Fanclub! Most of us have met it someday. I took a picture but my phone behaved at its own, deleting the photo
- Qrosstum is very careful about its identity. When it walks between us, it ensures no one who knows it is around, so it won't be revealed.
- A Tamigucho who have other Tamiguchos to tame? Qrosstum have its own ID as a human and can capture and train creatures so as humans can. But no one knows how it got a legit human ID despite being a Tamigucho.
- About Qrosstum, I don't think she's simply a Tamigucho. She may be a powerful human rather than a Tamigucho. As we read from the Temporary city, humans and Tamiguchos used to be one in the distant past. That's why we should treat Tamiguchos with the same rights we guarantee to humans.
- What came first, the egg or the Tamigucho? What Qrosstum are: a Tamigucho who can turn human or a human who can turn Tamigucho?
- No Tamigucho have a license to behave as a tamer and have a human ID, except Qrosstum.
- Ark... ...what is its name? We heard it made a universe... ...or more, and that Qrosstum is "its right-arm".
- Qrosstum's right arm is a pearl, and the left one is a diamond. It is said she uses both hands when opening a wormhole to another universe.
- Music is time. An image is space. You quickly look at an image and you already know it. But for music, you'll have to wait for its entirety to pass.
- I agree. Adding: Join images and you have a GIF. GIFs are time. Join a GIF with a music and you have a video. Videos are space and time! Images are space, music is time.
- Team Quantic is a criminal group; but Team Petami is something more. They looked like a sect
- [DISCS STORE] I love how these media have A and B sides. You can put the same music but in different versions on each side!
- [DISCS STORE] Our universe may be a side A or B of other universes. Yes, I'm a retro nostalgy fan, but as all of mugenkizuna citizens, I'm also fan of quantum science!
- All Tamiguchos are able to indirectly feel the aura of humans. But none is able to see it, as fair as I know. Unless the data from the Leaked city, oops, the Temporary city, could be right.
- I have news about the Temporary city, too! We've heard of two Tamiguchos in a distant universe. One of them is Paerla. It can travel through alternate universes, but only the related ones. It remembers me about Celebrant of Timelines, who can travel only in the same timeline.

Tamiguchos favours for Pok√©mon:
- Expand it
- Show the B side of it, a broader universe to be explored
- Explain some things about Pok√©mon that aren't detailed in Pok√©mon
- Defend the monverse from the controverses it was involved
-
Merging with or accepting that Tamigucho exist isnt their choice.
We cannot choose if another parallel universe exist or not; simply everything exist; there's a place for everything.

Tamigucho attacks:
- Water squirt
- Scratch
- Dodge (the 5th slot)
- Root whip (known by Treearth)
- Sleepy Sing
- Calming Sing (decreases atk/def)
- Rain dance
- Sunny dance
- Acid rain (known by Waterain sp form)
- Tackle
- Bitype STAB
- Tritype STAB

Tamigucho Competitive Simulator (Tamiguchos and their stats; types - special and bodily - and their effectiveness/resistance/weakness; atks, their types, PP/morale/histamine? and stats; evasive/dodging, attack elementary combinations and their timing/chance)
Best Tamiguchos for starting the Tami CS:
- Froquirrel (water/electric, rubber - uses its rubber cheeks)
- Treearth (vegetable, plant/grass/wood - fire atks are stronger in the leaves than in the wood)
- Sprouterra (vegetable/soil/water - fire atks are less effective in the soil while electric atks are effectless)
- Petalrock (mineral/rock, vegetable - uses its algaes to protect agaisnt water. the more water is algaes get, the more they cover its body)

Bond link between tamigucho and tamer
This enables them to fight in real time without RPG
This resource can only be used if the other tamer have it too; also, it only works if the tamer and the tamigucho share a strong bond. From both tamers, it will require a special device.

Tamigucho anime, based in: https://twitter.com/pokeyugami/status/1527576053014618112
Episodes:
- Pilot (learning skate: - you are good for someone who is still learning - ah, its just about using all of the same interior force and meditation from when you are learning bike!)
- introduce disabled characters in next episodes
- (visit to the Botami Garden, where the character buys a dogs nest to protect hr skirt)
- Tell the story of Isaac Newmon and his favorite apple tree (which later he discovers is a Treearth, and the rock he was sitting is Petalrock).
Newmon presents the real perspective about what is a mon "evolving" (wasn't it Darwin?)
- Isaac Asimon and the three laws of robotics
- Nature's language (a seaside tamer tries to train its Lll to talk, such as speaking "sea", training for 5 years without much result)
-
2nd generation will have episode about how TamiBalls were invented

4 gen: Tamigucho Salt & Sugar

Tamigucho site:
- Fix the mistakes done from Pok√©mon (no NFTs for pets like Mew, bias)
- Bring diversity to the already flourishing niche/genre of mon-catching
- Stablish a linked multiverse for interoperability

Tamiguchos that should undergo two morphs after the update, will receive a bonus Level Candy üç≠ so instantly going 3rd stage
- add at least 11 Tamiguchos to each egg group. a fusion can generate two different Tamiguchos and follows Mendel Law
-
TamiRanch will support up to  Tamiguchos (because of fusion essence breeding + albino (custom) + radio (custom) + glowing (inverted colors filter))
TamiRanch will support up to 500,000 Tamis!

tami DAO ideas:
- Tamigucho DAO General Governance: suggest to tami anime/game, it is secretly accepted and marked as accepted one week after official public launch

tami Pink & Blue ideas:
Tamigucho P&B alpha will be based in the same glitch city as of the Munnah region's one.
Buglitch and Missinglitch will appear but not catchable.
NPCs will talk (also about 440 volts is standard using a biosafe kind of electricity) and there will be doors to travel to cities or enter buildings
Another NPC phrase: about the chip applied to a caught Tamigucho and how the same method is done for held items
Another NPC will tell magnectic levitation was prohibitted (that may explain Neurus Phone)
- Held item assigning animation
- morph animation and music
- Mt Olymnet will have a stone drawing for Funry
- card catch animation, with a round progress bar w/ hrglss
- a tamigucho can throw tamistorage to any direction, including to hit/take HP from player
- transformation animation and music; first to receive one: Bulblast and Treearth
- Tami FusedBreeding study: https://pastebin.com/yuVdqRFC

tami care app ideas:
- Tamigucho will have OT (Original Tamer), a history of ownership transfers, and Current Tamer (CT).
