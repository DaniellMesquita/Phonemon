Tamigucho C & O (plot: plants vs. animals, environmental dillemas, ecofsc, collective sucdl, drgs and dealing with the human side of, Team Petami)
-
Team Petami uses the eco concerns as weapon to eliminate humans (while doing so to the Tamiguchos, instead - until it is told humans are the true victims in the Tamigucho world). Qrosstum will tell about the human/animals universe where an equivalent of Team Petami wants creatures using humans to battle and hurting them as revenge while the team itself is decimating animals
