4th game is based in a space/time distortion region, with Team Quantic and Qrosstum as legendary
TamiStorages' Stickerffects
Games: Tamigucho A & B (+Z)
Region: mugenkizuna ÁÑ°ÈôêÁµÜ Infinite bond (Munnah as western version of the name)
Locations:
- New Palleaf
- Vererna Forest (Gruboll, Boboll)
- Mt. Coronoon (Funry)
phrases by NPCs:
- Technology got so advanced, that a machine to read not only emotions and dreams, but also fully translate what a Tamigucho is meaning, is already available!
- A region that had a war? We call it Warto. The new champion was son of that team's leader. These are some of the data we found in the Temporary city
- mugenkizuna/munnah was the first region of the Tamigucho universe, fruit of a space/time distortion. Its origin? Some say it is Mt. Coronoon
- Qrosstum is the only creature known to travel through the multiverse, being cross-universe.
- Qrosstum have a special love for the Tamigucho universe; may it be the cause of space/time distortions and our origin? Some say Qrosstum regularly visits or even lives in Mt. Coronoon, but no expedition ever was able to confirm it
- Qrosstum have so many universes to visit in the infinite multiverse, that I doubt it only have a preferred one
- Team Quantic affirm Qrosstum exist, and some say to have seen it; but no video footage available so... ...legends are just legends.
- Until someone proves it exist, nobody can affirm it don't exist!
- Mt. Coronoon reaches all of the 4 edges of the region. Paradoxically, it is the most accessible and most inaccessible place at the same time.
- You can enter Mt. Coronoon from any place, easily; but on the other hand, advancing on it is hard
- Qrosstum is the most powerful Tamigucho...  ...except that, there's only one creature that can beat Qrosstum, and it isn't here in the Tamigucho universe
- The creature that made Qrosstum? Its name is a mix between Archaic, hmmmm, Ark, and Zeus, according to the fragmented data we got from the Temporary city
- In other universes, probably Tamiguchos aren't known as Tamiguchos. As we seek to explore planets, the next frontier is exploring universes and the time
- Based in data from the Temporary City, in pre-ancient times humans and other creatures were one. If these creatures can be called Tamiguchos, then... ...are humans some sort of Tamiguchos?
- Any TamiStorage, such as TamiCards and TamiBlocks, are charged everyday, everyhour nonstopping! Both by darkness and light, be it natural or artificial, there's no condition preventing the containing tamiguchos from receiving life/energy!
- When you store a Tamigucho inside a card or block, they are converted from matter to energy. TamiBlocks is a primitive storage but still used nowadays that we have tinner, flat cards!
- What happens inside TamiStorages such as TamiCards or TamiBlocks? You wonder; everybody wonders! When Tamiguchos are converted into energy, an environment made of energy is also artificially created, stored in the RAM. It can be a garden, a lake, a forest, a jungle, a sea! If you ask you are right: Tamiguchos are consciously awake inside TamiStorages, so they need a nice environment they love to live in! They don't need to eat as energy, but probably they'll always want to play and rest!
- Tamiguchos can enter or leave TamiStorages at their own pace and will, as they are conscientious inside it, just as they were when inside an egg.
- He's right! Ah, yes, just as they were in the egg: they are aware of everything happening outside, and can even feel the energy and heat of their tamer and colleagues of neighbor TamiStorages!
- Most of the data collected in the Temporary city are in the hands of Team Quantic. Probably they were aware a space/time distortion could make a place or a whole city and eagerly expecting for it. I'm sure they have maps and data of many universes
- A villainous team of the hypothetical Warto region... ...Team Red? wanted to conquer the world. A villainous team of the hypothetical region of... ...Sinnabar? They wanted to conquer the universe. But Team Quantic? They are insane! They want to catch the hypothetical Qrosstum to travel and conquer many hypothetical universes...
- Did I just heard about the Warto and that Cinnamon, err, Sinnabar region? The scientists who studied in the Temporary city, said parts of these regions were merged and became part of our region! Data also pointed that the Tamigucho universe is made of, well, contains parts of a lot of different universes. This may explain why Qrosstum is said to have a so special affection for this region... ...I mean, if it ever existed, in the first place!
- If all of that news are just legends... ...why that Temporary city suddenly appeared next to Mt. Coronoon's Quantum Temple? This was even filmed and covered extensively. But, unfortunately, no one ever was able to record Qrosstum... ...yet!
- Who was able to see the Temporary city? Everyone! But who was able to enter it? Scientists and officers, before they were forcibly removed by Team Quantic.
- Scientists who visited the Temporary city were robbed and had to leave. But they bought their memory with them and we were able to know some things that Team Quantic knows better than us. But we aren't ignorant at all!
- My favorite leaked data about the Temporary city? Is about the Wormorph's relatives in other universes. There are a slimmy thing that is result of an unsuccessful clone, but despite failed both this slime and Wormorph had a library-like DNA preserved. I don't see them as a failure. Some great discoveries were made off "failures"!
- Both male and female Funry are fungus... ...and fairies, and from the same species. But why are them so different?
- Scientists don't lose their attention when the topic is about other scientists. They heard and told us about a weird scientist from an other universe. Jimmy, was once part of a criminal group but debanded and turned into a great scientist. Despite being part of a villainous team, they never were truly evil. We look forward to hear more but data is so fragmented and mixed with rumors, that we got ourselves lost on them. Probably Team Quantic knows what is sound and what is noise!
- I don't appreciate incomplete information. That scientist? One of his experiments was teaching creatures to talk! They were also teaching slimmy creatures to be more confident, social and improve their mimicking.
- In our region, even the non-scientists loves to talk about quantum things! Its in our DNA! The dead cat is alive ahoooo!
- That scientist Jimmy? He found back his... ...Firember? His loyal friend returned and they never more separated. His friend from the former villainous team was also officially captured by him. He merged all his friends from past and present!
- I don't know a thing about that scientist. The information we got at Temporary city is very scarce.
- Traveling through universes, and traveling in time are the same thing! We heard of a creature called "Celebrant of Times" who was able to timetravel, but never heard of traveling through universes. Probably this creature was able to travel through a single track, in this case a single timeline! But every quantum second that passes, we and our actions are creating new universes that we simply call "time passing". Creating universes is easy, but undoing actions or traveling through them? I've heard only Qrosstum is able to.
- A folkloric, legendary, mythical Tamigucho: they may appear unique but there may be more than one individuals from the same specie. Can they reproduce? They are genderless and most say they can't. But yes, they can and they do. But not in captivity. Their reproduction is rare even in their native environment.
- If NestHouses, daycares were able to reproduce mythical Tamiguchos, that would pose a risk to the very species and, to all other including humans
- Past, future and present may be mixed in a space/time distortion. At the Temporary city, we got confusing facts about the same stuff but in different timelines.
- Why people are surprised with that Temporary city? Space/time distortions are common in our region, even the multiversal ones!
- There are no "default" and "alternate" universes. Earth isn't the only planet nor the center of our universe. Same about universes: our universe is also "alternative" to other universes, so there's no default. That's relative.
- People say "alternate universes" as if our universe were normal and all others weird. We shall drop that multiversal phobias, bias. Out of our comfort zone, we should accept the fact that our very universe is also weird to the others!
- Probably other universes don't know about the Tamigucho universe. But we are somewhat aware about theirs! That's a nice privilege Qrosstum gave us.
- I was once able to talk Qrosstum! I asked for a multiversal travel but she said only special people can travel with her. Qrosstum also said other things, but asked me to be confident so I'll respect. I shouldn't even share this, as telling I know poses me a risk.
- I was with him in this day when we met her. She's soooo sweet! We became friends! She transformed into human and we used to walk together! But now she's busy ü§ï
- This is the Qrosstum Fanclub! Most of us have met it someday. I took a picture but my phone behaved at its own, deleting the photo
- Qrosstum is very careful about its identity. When it walks between us, it ensures no one who knows it is around, so it won't be revealed.
- A Tamigucho who have other Tamiguchos to tame? Qrosstum have its own ID as a human and can capture and train creatures so as humans can. But no one knows how it got a legit human ID despite being a Tamigucho.
- About Qrosstum, I don't think she's simply a Tamigucho. She may be a powerful human rather than a Tamigucho. As we read from the Temporary city, humans and Tamiguchos used to be one in the distant past. That's why we should treat Tamiguchos with the same rights we guarantee to humans.
- What came first, the egg or the Tamigucho? What Qrosstum are: a Tamigucho who can turn human or a human who can turn Tamigucho?
- No Tamigucho have a license to behave as a tamer and have a human ID, except Qrosstum.
- Ark... ...what is its name? We heard it made a universe... ...or more, and that Qrosstum is "its right-arm".
- Qrosstum's right arm is a pearl, and the left one is a diamond. It is said she uses both hands when opening a wormhole to another universe.
- Music is time. An image is space. You quickly look at an image and you already know it. But for music, you'll have to wait for its entirety to pass.
- I agree. Adding: Join images and you have a GIF. GIFs are time. Join a GIF with a music and you have a video. Videos are space and time! Images are space, music is time.
- Team Quantic is a criminal group; but Team Petami is something more. They looked like a sect
- [DISCS STORE] I love how these media have A and B sides. You can put the same music but in different versions on each side!
- [DISCS STORE] Our universe may be a side A or B of other universes. Yes, I'm a retro nostalgy fan, but as all of mugenkizuna/munnah citizens, I'm also fan of quantum science!
- All Tamiguchos are able to indirectly feel the aura of humans. But none is able to see it, as fair as I know. Unless the data from the Leaked city, oops, the Temporary city, could be right.
- I have news about the Temporary city, too! We've heard of two Tamiguchos in a distant universe. One of them is Paerla. One can travel through alternate universes, but only the related ones. It remembers me about Celebrant of Timelines, who can travel only in the same timeline.
