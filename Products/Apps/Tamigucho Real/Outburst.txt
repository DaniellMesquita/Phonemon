I'm tired of having an idea for the monverse but not being able to implement it.

That happened when back in 2013/2014 (can prove it through Verifact in Facebook's Messenger) I had the idea for a "Pokemon Real" game and then Pokemon Go came in 2016.

I'm afraid not being able to develop & launch Tamigucho Real for Apple Vision PRO before Pokemon do it.
